We had to upgrade to 2.1.10 to get a fix for https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/pull/9

This necessited switching off of the Ubuntu repo to a manual install, which changed config stuff

Old servers should be apt-get purge'd, and all processes terminated.


how to build mod_log_chat.beam:
--------
svn co https://svn.process-one.net/ejabberd-modules
cd ejabberd-modules/mod_log_chat/trunk
./build.sh
cp ebin/mod_log_chat.beam .... (e.g. /lib/ejabberd/ebin/)
# Example config is in conf/ejabberd.conf.sample
# (be sure to create the log file's directory)

(and likewise for mod_muc_admin.beam)
