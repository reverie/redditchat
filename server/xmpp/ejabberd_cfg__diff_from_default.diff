< %% max_fsm_queue: Enable limiting of lengths of "message queues"
< %% for outgoing connections. Roughly speaking, each message in such
< %% queues represents one XML stanza queued to be sent into
< %% an output stream it is serving.
< %% The default value is an atom 'undefined' which specifies no limiting.
< %%
< %% When specified globally, this option limits the message queue lengths
< %% for all ejabberd_c2s_in and ejabberd_service listeners,
< %% as well as for outgoing s2s connections.
< %%
< %% This option can also be specified as an option for ejabberd_c2s_in
< %% and ejabberd_service listeners, in wich case it will override
< %% the value of the global option.
